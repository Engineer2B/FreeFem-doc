# Welcome to FreeFem++ documentation

[FreeFem++](https://freefem.github.io/FreeFem-website/) is a partial differential equation solver for non-linear multi-physics systems in 2D and 3D.

Problems involving partial differential equations from several branches of physics such as fluid-structure interactions require interpolations of data on several meshes and their manipulation within one program.
FreeFem++ includes a fast interpolation algorithm and a language for the manipulation of data on multiple meshes.

FreeFem++ is written in C++ and its language is a C++ idiom.
